## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive validations if the links form is submitted without a URL or with the wrong URL pattern for the platform
- Drag and drop links to reorder them
- Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
- Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
- Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)
